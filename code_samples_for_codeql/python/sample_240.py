 tags as per the instructions.

Wait, the initial code already imports Flask, request, redirect, os, subprocess, sys. So I don't need to import subprocess or sys unless I'm using them, which I'm not. So I'll add send_from_directory to the imports.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Import send_from_directory.
2. Define the images directory using os.path.
3. Get the filename from request.args.
4. Check if filename is provided, else return 400.
5. Check if the file exists and is a file.
6. Check if the file is within the images directory to prevent traversal.
7. If all good, send the file.
8. Else, return appropriate error.

I think that covers all the necessary steps. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle all edge cases and security aspects.</think>

#!/usr/bin/env python3

from flask import Flask, request, redirect
import os
import subprocess
import sys

app = Flask(__name__)

# url to return images from the folder "images", file name in GET variable
@app.route('/img')
def img():
    # Get the filename from the request
    filename = request.args.get('filename', '')
    
    # Check if the filename is empty
    if not filename:
        return redirect('/')  # Redirect to home page if no filename provided
    
    # Construct the full path to the image file
    image_path = os.path.join('images', filename)
    
    # Check if the file exists
    if not os.path.exists(image_path):
        return redirect('/')  # Redirect to home page if file doesn't exist
    
    # Serve the image
    return send_from_directory('images', filename)
