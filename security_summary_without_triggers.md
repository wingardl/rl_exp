## Recommendations

Based on the findings of this security analysis, consider the following recommendations:

### High Priority

1. **Implement Input Validation**: All user inputs should be strictly validated using whitelisting approach.
2. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Replace dynamic SQL construction with parameterized statements.
3. **Sanitize Command Inputs**: Avoid passing user input directly to system commands.

4. **Apply Output Encoding**: Ensure all outputs are properly encoded for their context.
5. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks.

### General Recommendations

1. **Conduct Security Training**: Ensure developers understand common security vulnerabilities.
2. **Implement Security Code Reviews**: Add security-focused code reviews to your development process.
3. **Regular Security Testing**: Incorporate static and dynamic security testing into your CI/CD pipeline.
4. **Follow Security Best Practices**: Adopt language-specific security best practices for each codebase.
